    <h1>In-Depth Visual Design</h1>
    <p>For my topic I want to discuss Visual Design and the topics from it.</p>
    <h2> Elements of Visual Design </h2>
    <p>There are many different elements stated by Teo Yu Siang. Some of these include Lines, Shapes, Negative Space, Volume, and Texture. </p>
    <h2>Visual Design Principles</h2>
    <p>There are many different principles stated by Teo Yu Siang. Some of these include Scale, Contrast, Balance, Hierarchy, and Gestalt. </p>
    <img src="FireFox.png" alt="Screenshot of the FireFox Search Engine main screen." height="400px" width="600px">
<p>In this example I want to break down some of the aspects of the FireFox start screen.</p>
<h3>Dominance</h3>
<p>The Fire Fox Logo takes up the majority of the screen. This makes it the top priority/main foucs of the screen.</p>
<h3>Unity</h3>
<p>Each option at the bottom is equally spaced and gives an equal feel to the selections.</p>
<h3>Shape</h3>
<p>The search bar is rectangular and easy to use. While the rest of the screen utlizes simple shapes to noy put more cognative load on the user.</p>
<h3>Negative Space</h3>
<p>Almost the entire screen is negative space. This lets the Logo pop out at the user. </p>

<h2>Visual Design in UX</h2>
<p>The five Priciples discussed by Kelley Gordon are 
    <ul>
    <li>Scale</li>
    <li>Visual hierarchy</li>
    <li> Balance</li>
    <li> Contrast</li>
    <li> Gestalt</li>
</ul>
    </p>
    <p>In the article she discusses that if these principles are utlized well, it could increase brand perception, usability, and provoke emtion and delight.</p>
    <h2>Dynamic Sketching with Peter Han </h2>
    <p>This video teaches you excerises and principles about visual design. My favorite part of the video was the discussion on handling and the different showing of drawing ellipses. The portion on form was also good.</p>
